ðŸ§  Problem Statement

Marketing teams often run various types of campaignsâ€”email, social media, print adsâ€”hoping to drive product sales. However, it's challenging to accurately forecast the number of product orders each campaign might generate. Misjudging these numbers can result in wasted resources, missed targets, or inefficient budget use.

This solution helps:
- ðŸ§© Optimize campaign strategies  
- ðŸ’¸ Maximize marketing ROI  
- ðŸ“ˆ Forecast product demand more accurately
